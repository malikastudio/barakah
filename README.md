# 🌱 Barakah Library for Social Good

Welcome to the **Barakah Library for Social Good** — an open-source, digitally organized private library focused on collecting, cataloging, and sharing books that foster **social impact**, **communal understanding**, and **personal growth**.

This project is a labor of love for readers, educators, community leaders, and lifelong learners who believe that knowledge is a tool for transformation. Our goal is to make it easier to discover and access books that inspire action, empathy, and equity.
